Hello!

You are most welcome to participate, contribute and critize the framework.

I 100% agree that I do not agree with some of the points you raised in the forum or on the Github and that's the human nature. I also agree that framework is not 100% perfect and there is always room for improvements. For example this particular issue https://github.com/adonisjs/adonis-framework/issues/718, I agree that framework implementation was wrong and changed it.

You know there is always context attached to everything, your views are defined from the type of work you do, people you meet and same is for me.

But when writing the framework, I have to keep following things in mind.

1. It should serve a majority of people and should not be tailored for individual needs.
2. The position of the framework in the community. At times I have to leave features, since they change the personality of the framework.
3. Build around established concepts.

The recent debates we had for CSRF token, where one of your reply was `What is the technical limitations?`.
Frankly saying, after this it's hard to put your views, there are no technical limitations anywhere, it's more about established ideas the community had for years.
